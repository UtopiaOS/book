<p><em>By Diego Magdaleno</em></p>
<p>This version of the text asumes you're somewhat experience with computers and development, and that you are running the latest version of Utopia.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="foreword"><a class="header" href="#foreword">Foreword</a></h1>
<p>The vision of the Utopia Operating System was always clear, when it was born, Utopia was primarily about <em>empowerment</em>:
No matter what kind of user you are, Utopia empowers you to use and do the best you can in your computer, Utopia tries to give
wonderful people, wonderful tools, so they can do wonderful things.</p>
<p>Take for example, the state of package managers and the fragmentation the Linux community experiences because of this, Utopia was made with the idea of fixing these fundamental issues, one step at a time, so not only your Operating System feels like one with the computer, but you can also spend less time figure out why things don't work, how to install multiple versions of a package or how to configure this or that tool, Utopia is made for the user.</p>
<p>Utopia was made with the average user in mind, that user that expects things to work out of the box, without compromising power, the idea of Utopia is to keep it simple, as long as you want that to be the case, Utopia was made for integration, everything is integrated as one big system, working together to provide the best experience that any other desktop could provide, Utopia feels natural to the user, is like he always used it, Utopia, was made for the user.</p>
<p>This book, for you, the developer, embraces the power and simplicity Utopia brings to the desktop ecosystem. It's a friendly and approachable text intended to help you just not level up your knowledge of Utopia and develop apps that feel like home, but to also reach the confidence you can use Utopia as your daily operating system. So dive in and get ready to learn -- And welcome to the Utopia community.</p>
<p>-- Diego Magdaleno</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>The Utopia Operating System</em>, an introductory book about Utopia. The Utopia Operating System, helps you experience a better, simpler and more cohesive computer experience. Operating systems are either too advanced or too simple. Utopia challenges that conflict. Through the community, discussions and personal experiences, Utopia manages to find a balance, between the power user and the user, Utopia gives you the power to control your operating system and computer, without the hassle associated with such control.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-utopia-for"><a class="header" href="#who-is-utopia-for">Who is Utopia for</a></h2>
<p>Utopia is ideal for many people for a varaiety of people, however, in the next sections we look at the biggest and most important ones.</p>
<h2 id="casual-users"><a class="header" href="#casual-users">Casual Users</a></h2>
<p>Utopia is made for the casual user that might their computer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch cat videos</li>
<li>Chat with some friends</li>
<li>Use a web browser</li>
<li>Edit some document file</li>
<li>Play a casual game</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Utopia the computer becomes a tool, Utopia is made for users with varying levels of knowledge about computers, and casual users aren't an execption to the Utopia operating system, with Utopia, the user is free to forget about what Operating system he is using. All thanks to the many tools and principles Utopia follows, the casual user can benefit from principles such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apps are self contained bundles</strong>: In Utopia, applications are just folders that contain the &quot;executable&quot;, is not expected to the user to know what any of that means, he just needs to know, he has to right click an app to open it and start enjoying the diverse variety of options the app might bring to his systems.</li>
<li><strong>The global menu</strong>: In Utopia, an user does not need to get user to the hambuguer or the custom menu each app might have, in Utopia, the top bar contains a global menu, which handles all the options the user might have for interacting with the application.</li>
<li><strong>The store</strong>: The store, is powered by libigloo, a UI-first package manager library, this makes the store experience, fast, simple and seamless, because it was designed to be specifically used with the backend and frontend, the user doesn't need to worry about the store showing him weird terminal outputs, or options he doesn't understand, going to the store, is just like in the real world.</li>
<li><strong>The dock</strong>: In Utopia, the favorite apps of the user, are always stored in the bottom-bar also known as the dock, the dock is a centric place, that tells you what applications are open, the option to close them, pin them.</li>
<li><strong>The lauchpad</strong>: The launchpad is a familiar phone-like homescreen that allows the user to see all the apps he hass installed on his computer, and remove them, sort them, or even quickly search to his liking.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using these tools and interfaces, the average user can feel at home while using his computer.</p>
<h2 id="power-users"><a class="header" href="#power-users">Power users</a></h2>
<p>Utopia is made for the power users that might use their computer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do heavy gaming</li>
<li>Tweak the computer to their likings</li>
<li>Modify the desktop or other aspects of the operating system</li>
<li>Block certain websites from loading</li>
<li>Modify system services </li>
<li>Modify low level system settings</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Utopia as a power user, your computer is completely yours, you have the power and freedom to disasble, all the systems that prevent you from modifying your system, but as always Utopia empowers you, the power user by providing tools and defaults that might your experience better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows apps run by default</strong>: Utopia uses sytemd-winefmt to run windows apps with a double click, while we can't ensure they are going to work as expected, basic apps should give the user an awesome experience out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>System wide configuration api</strong>: The user can format about dotfiles, or having thousands of files in different locations with different formats, Utopia provides a way for you, the developer, to integrate your settings directly into the system in an intuitive way, and for those who like files, Utopia translates settings from it's Database to a FUSE mountpoint in /Settings full of TOML files, so it's like the user has the classic config files.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting</strong>: Utopia empowers the users to perform certain actions, while at the time of writting this document is only planned for moving files around, the Utopia big brother file watcher, allows the user to run POSIX-compliant scripts when a certain action is performed.</li>
<li><strong>A package manager that empowers the user</strong>: Winter is a highly costumizable package manager, you're free to add third party repos, change the vendor of some packages, install propiteraty software, change your kernel, make your own packages, etc, all while being sure, the SAT solver ensures your dependencies dont break.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple versions of the same app</strong>: The power user can forget about doing crazy workarounds to run older versions of the app, just so he can have features that might be removed in newer versions, Utopia is designed so users can run multiple versions of the app by default.</li>
<li><strong>A terminal that helps you</strong>: Utopia ships with a third party terminal, named warp, it combines the aspects of a classic text-based interface and the modernity of having buttons, quick actions and tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using these tools, interfaces and commonidities, a power user can feel even more empowered to mofify and tweak his system.</p>
<h2 id="developers"><a class="header" href="#developers">Developers</a></h2>
<p>Utopia is made for developers that might use their computer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit source code on their computer</li>
<li>Run multiple instances of a program</li>
<li>Debug software</li>
<li>Write documentation on diverse platforms</li>
<li>Need to research an specific topic</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Utopia as a developer, your computer, becomes a powerful tool for writting software, not only you as a developer benefit from all the features that were discussed above, but Utopia provides you, the developer with tools that make developing on Utopia more powerful than ever:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified package directory</strong>: In Utopia, all your global packages, coming from Python, npm, rubygems, you name it, are unified in a single FUSE mountpoint at /Aliens, which allows you to quickly list the directories, and so, get a quick list of every single package that you might have installed on your system, including third party packages.</li>
<li><strong>Multple versions of the same software</strong>: Does your software require Python 3.9? or Python 3.7?, on other operating systems, you would have to experience the hassle of downlading tools, adding them to your path, and be frustrated because a requirement is not availible, in Utopia, you just need to open your terminal, and use Winter to install the version you desire, after this, you can set which version of the package gets activated per directory.</li>
<li><strong>Developer environments</strong>: The design of Winter allows you the developer to create environemtns that run specific versions of software, so you can link with the proper libraries, or include the right header files.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives system</strong>: Utopia provides an api for developers to register alternatives to common software, that are more than symlinks, you can set them per directory, for example, one could have one directory, use sh as the main shell, and another using zsh, as both are registred alternatives for a POSIX shell.</li>
<li><strong>LaunchServices</strong>: Do you miss the <code>open</code> command other operating systems have?, well not on Utopia, Utopia introduces its own implementation of LaunchServices, so you can do open your from terminal, and open the file in your favorite app!.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using this apis, inferfaces and tools, the developer can feel at home and more empowered to write software on Utopia, or even for Utopia.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-for"><a class="header" href="#who-is-this-book-for">Who is this book for</a></h2>
<p>This book assumes you have already used Linux systems, written code in some programming language, and used developer tools, but it doesn't make any assumptions about what programming language you used, what interface you used or what Linux operating system you come from. We try to approach you knowing developers have a variety of backgrounds, so don't worry, we hope this book makes it easy for you, the developer to enjoy and understand our operating system, is which also yours.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to use this book</a></h2>
<p>This book asumes you are reading it from front to back, this means from the title page to the conclusions. It is important you don't skip sections, or chapters, as Utopia design desicions are explained, by building on knowledge you got from previous chapters, and if a chapter does not delve into a topic that is mentioned, we typically come back to it later, just like when you learnt programming.</p>

<p>This chapter covers and explains each Utopia <em>proposal</em>, a proposal refers to a change we the Utopia developers did to Linux, or how we would like things to work in some aspects of the operating system. Some of this concepts might not be unique to Utopia, so they can help you understand other operating systems, however that is out of scope.</p>
<p>Specifically, you learn why we designed some things the way they were designed, what problems they solve and what pros and cons they have, the details about each proposal and their implementations might be discussed in later chapters.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="neofhs"><a class="header" href="#neofhs">NeoFHS</a></h2>
<p>NeoFHS stands for Neo (Greek for new) File Hierarchy Standard, it builds up on the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">FreeDesktop File Hiearchy Standard</a>, and tries to make it more intuitive, providing human readable names in the english language by default.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>A file hiearchy standard, refers to the way diverse system components are stored across the computer, for example, if you come from a typical Linux background, you might be familiar with executables being on <code>/bin</code>or <code>/usr/bin</code> your user being on <code>/home</code>, or if you come from Windows, you might be used to programs being on <code>C:\Program Files</code>, in the same way, Utopia defines it's own FHS, where it expects diverse files to be located, and where the end user, might expect to find things.</p>
<p>The NeoFHS tries to simplify things and remove legacy directories or desicisions that where made just to acomodate the fragmentation (such as the /usr merge), it is heavily inspired by <a href="https://gobolinux.org">GoboLinux</a> but with some improvements over the top, mainly, in the organization and separation of some types of software (For example, in Utopia /Programs and /Applications are different things).</p>
<p>NeoFHS is built with this ideas in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mother path (root path) should always be capitalized (<code>/Programs</code>, <code>/System</code>)</li>
<li>A path should always be human readable (this means no <code>/usr</code> or <code>/etc</code>) and use common and simple english words</li>
<li>Paths should be explicit in their name about what they contain</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have discussed the reasons and principals behind the NeoFHS, we can start examining how a common Utopia System is organized.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the new FHS attempts to be more intuitive, using plain english and benefiting from the fact our modern computers can handle very large paths.</p>
<p>It also benefits some Utopia desicions, for example, thanks to this design, it is possible to apply a Symlink Style Package Manager, which allows users to have multiple versions of the same package.</p>
<h3 id="surviving-alongside-the-legacy-tree"><a class="header" href="#surviving-alongside-the-legacy-tree">Surviving alongside the legacy tree</a></h3>
<p>The first problem that might emerge when looking at the new FHS, is, <strong>How the hell does this not break the whole OS?</strong>, and to answer your question, it does break the whole OS, or it would, if it wasn't for the amazing power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">Symbolic Links</a>, thanks to Symlinks (Symbolic Links) we can keep the old file hiearchy there, while also having the benefits of the new one as Applications adapt overtime.</p>
<p>To make the story short, in case you don't know what a symlink is, think about it like a shortcut, yes, the same one your gradma has lots of on her desktop, these shortcuts aren't <em>really</em> the program, but rather, a quickway to access the location of said program, this design, allows you to make <code>/etc</code> on the old FHS a &quot;shortcut&quot; to <code>/System/Settings</code> on our new FHS.</p>
<p>Below, you can see what parts of the old FHS are symlinked to our new FHS, in case you didn't click on the first link where we mentioned the current FHS, it is recommend you do that now by clicking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">here</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see above, this implementation allows us to ensure programs don't really need to update directory to support our new FHS (but we would like to), rather, a program can read a file located at <code>/etc/my_settings.toml</code> and a little bit of filesystem magic will redirect this call to the real file at <code>/System/Settings/my_settings.toml</code>, however, even after this, we still have one big problem: <strong>Repeated folders</strong>, what do we mean with this, is nobody wants to see <code>/etc</code> if <code>/System/Settings</code>is already thing, however, there is a solution to this, used in diverse operating systems, such as Windows and macOS: <strong>hidden files</strong>, our solution is borrowed from our friends at GoboLinux and it ensures a clean and elegant way of hidding directories.</p>
<p>While you can read about the solution GoboLinux used <a href="https://gobolinux.org/doc/articles/gobohide.html">here</a> in a nutshell, it keeps a list of the <code>inodes</code> in a kernel linked list, after this, when performing the <code>readdir()</code> syscall, the kernel verifies if said inode is on the <code>inode</code> list, if this is true, it wont be copied to the destination buffer.</p>
