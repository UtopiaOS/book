# The Utopia proposals

In this chapter, you will find _proposals_ for Utopia. Proposals refer to changes that we, the Utopia Developers, did or might do to Linux and how we might change paradigms for Utopia. We will try to be in depth in how these proposals will or would affect Utopia along with potential pros and cons. The implementations of these proposals may or may not be discussed in future chapters.
