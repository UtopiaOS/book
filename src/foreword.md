# Foreword

The vision of the Utopia Operating System was always clear. When it was born, Utopia was primarily about _empowerment_:
No matter what kind of user you are, Utopia empowers you to use your computer to its fullest ability. Utopia tries to give wonderful people, wonderful tools, so they can do wonderful things. Utopia represents unification along with an attempt to make art out of an operating system. Utopia can be compared to a luxury watch, all the pieces collaborating and building off of each other and are all tied together, but for the user it's just a nice way to check the time. 

Everything in Utopia is built from the ground up to solve fundamental problems that the Linux community were unable to solve. For example, there is no fragmentation in Utopia because everything is tightly connected. You don't have to worry about dependency conflicts or managing multiple versions of packages because Utopia handles all of that for you.

Utopia was built with a wide range of users in mind, from the average user to a power user or developer. Everything should work out of the box like all of these users expect without compromising advanced functionality. Utopia, by default, is kept simple, unless you don't wish that to be the case. Utopia should feel natural to the user, as if it's something they've used their whole life, and it achieves this using a high level of integration between system components from the desktop to the userland to the kernel.
 
This book, designed for you, a developer for the Utopia Operating System, shows off the power and simplicity Utopia strives to bring to your computer. It's a friendly and approachable text intended to help you not just increase your knowledge of Utopia and develop apps that feel native to it, but also to reach the confidence level that you can use Utopia as your main operating system. So dive in and get ready to learn -- And welcome to the Utopia community.
