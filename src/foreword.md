# Foreword

The vision of the Utopia Operating System was always clear, when it was born, Utopia was primarily about _empowerment_:
No matter what kind of user you are, Utopia empowers you to use and do the best you can in your computer, Utopia tries to give
wonderful people, wonderful tools, so they can do wonderful things.

Take for example, the state of package managers and the fragmentation the Linux community experiences because of this, Utopia was made with the idea of fixing these fundamental issues, one step at a time, so not only your Operating System feels like one with the computer, but you can also spend less time figure out why things don't work, how to install multiple versions of a package or how to configure this or that tool, Utopia is made for the user.

Utopia was made with the average user in mind, that user that expects things to work out of the box, without compromising power, the idea of Utopia is to keep it simple, as long as you want that to be the case, Utopia was made for integration, everything is integrated as one big system, working together to provide the best experience that any other desktop could provide, Utopia feels natural to the user, is like he always used it, Utopia, was made for the user.

This book, for you, the developer, embraces the power and simplicity Utopia brings to the desktop ecosystem. It's a friendly and approachable text intended to help you just not level up your knowledge of Utopia and develop apps that feel like home, but to also reach the confidence you can use Utopia as your daily operating system. So dive in and get ready to learn -- And welcome to the Utopia community.
